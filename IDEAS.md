### Memory palace cities

Cities dedicated to emotions, landscapes where memories are stored in the form of objects. Over time the memories decay and new memories are formed on top

* Our digital devices allow us to exist without bodies
* Decay of memories stored in both physical and digital objects
* Abstract memories and experiences as a way to heal from traumas

#### Stuff to start

* Model some rooms
* Test out three js and try to make some primitive shapes and give them textures
* Create some objects from memories
